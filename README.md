## Hand Gesture Recognition using open-cv
The purpose of this project was to detect number of fingers in images/videos without using Machine/Deep Learning. So, this has been done using only Image Processing, and it is much faster than ML/DL solutions on a normal system. However, it is not as as accurate (backgrounds with similar color as that of skin can fool the detector).
